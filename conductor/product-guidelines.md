# Product Guidelines - lapt

## Communication and Feedback

- **Action-Oriented Status:** Status updates should be concise and use active verbs (e.g., "Scanning...", "Updating...").
- **Technical Detail for Errors:** Errors should be informative, providing technical details necessary for troubleshooting while remaining accessible.
- **Supportive Guidance:** When actions fail or cannot be completed, provide helpful prompts or suggestions for the next steps.

## UI/UX Design Principles

- **Zonal Consistency:** The interface is divided into fixed zones (e.g., Tab bar, Package List, Detail Panel, Status Bar). Elements should remain in their designated zones to help users build muscle memory and find information quickly.
- **Contextual Awareness:** The UI should dynamically adapt to show only relevant information and shortcuts. Elements that are not applicable to the current context (e.g., certain keyboard shortcuts or menu items) should be hidden or disabled to reduce clutter.
- **Responsiveness:** Maintain a high frame rate and use smooth transitions (via tachyonfx) to ensure the interface feels responsive to user input.
